				<p>In this project, I redesigned and extended one of the key components involved in the delivery process of Amazon's Android app. For this redesign, I focused on expanding the features from the post-purchase stage of the consumer's delivery experience to improve the effectiveness of communication between Amazon and their consumers.</p>
				<p>Oftentimes, not much consideration is given in enhancing this particular communications stage of the post-purchase process of delivery as seen through an increasing number of customer complaints labeling their delivery experiences as unsatisfactory. The goal of this project aims to address this ongoing communication issue involving the lack of delivery transparency and order miscommunications causing these consumer dissatisfactions.</p>
				<p>Through this concept of an improved communication system, Amazon consumers would be provided with an open and transparent delivery service platform that effectively and efficiently engages them in all stages of the delivery process.<p>
